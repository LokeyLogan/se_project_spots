**Description**

This project was an exciting and challenging introduction to Figma. It was a great opportunity to use @media for adapting the page to different screen sizes and to explore Grid as a styling method instead of Flexbox. Using Grid turned out to be the perfect choice for designing a social media page. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, despite the challenges, especially since social media is such a big part of my daily life
