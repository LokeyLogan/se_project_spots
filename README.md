### Overview

**Intro**

This project is a media webpage. It uses grids, Responsive design, and our breif was figma.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
